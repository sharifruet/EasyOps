Issue Materials:
  Manufacturing sends: productId, quantity, workOrderNumber
  Inventory processes: stock reduction, movement posting
  Inventory returns: issue confirmation
  Result: Stock decreased, movement recorded

Receive Finished Goods:
  Manufacturing sends: productId, quantity, unitCost, workOrderNumber
  Inventory processes: stock increase, movement posting
