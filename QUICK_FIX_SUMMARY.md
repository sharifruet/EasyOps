## üéØ Why This Happened

### The Cleanup Process
1. We removed duplicate Product entity from Sales Service (backend)
2. We removed duplicate Customer entity from Sales Service (backend)
3. Backend endpoints `/api/sales/products` and `/api/sales/customers` were deleted
4. Frontend was still calling those old endpoints ‚Üí 404 errors
5. **Now fixed**: Frontend calls correct services

### Proper Architecture
```
Frontend
  ‚Üì
salesService.getProducts()
  ‚Üì
/api/inventory/products (via API Gateway)
  ‚Üì
Inventory Service (8094)
  ‚Üì
inventory.products table
  ‚Üì
Returns 75 products ‚úÖ
```
