# EasyOps ERP – Requirements

## Purpose
This repository captures detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the EasyOps ERP application. It is organized by modules with consistent structure and terminology for easy discovery and maintenance.

## Scope
- Module requirements: Accounting, Sales, Inventory, CRM (and future modules like HR, Manufacturing, Procurement).
- Cross-cutting concerns: security, compliance, integrations, data, reporting, workflow, and platform-level NFRs.

## Structure
- `Module-Accounting/` – Accounting domain requirements
- `Module-Inventory/` – Inventory and warehouse requirements
- `Module-Sales/` – Sales and order-to-cash requirements
- `Module-CRM/` – Customer relationship management requirements
- `cross-cutting/` – Shared requirements across modules
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – Writing conventions and templates

## Conventions
- Use clear sectioning:
  - Problem statement
  - User roles & permissions
  - Entities & fields
  - Core flows (step-by-step)
  - Validations & business rules
  - Integrations & events
  - Reports & KPIs
  - Edge cases & exceptions
- Prefer bullet lists over long paragraphs; include fields and features.
- Keep module docs focused; use cross-cutting docs for shared topics (auth, RBAC, audit, localization, performance).

## Cross-cutting Requirements (overview)
- Security & Compliance (RBAC, audit trail, data retention, encryption, SoD)
- Data & Localization (multi-currency, multi-language, timezone)
- Integrations (APIs, webhooks, import/export, e-invoice, payment, logistics)
- Reporting & Analytics (KPI dashboards, exports, scheduler)
- Workflow & Automation (approvals, rules engine, notifications)
- Platform NFRs (availability, performance, scalability, backups)

See `cross-cutting/` documents for detailed specs.

## Roadmap
- Fill CRM module docs to match Accounting/Inventory/Sales depth
- Add cross-cutting specs (security, integrations, NFRs)
- Add per-module index and traceability to epics and user stories
