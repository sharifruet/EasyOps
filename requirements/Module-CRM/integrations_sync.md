# CRM: Integrations & Sync

## Problem Statement
Keep CRM aligned with external systems and channels without duplication.

## Connectors
- Email/Calendar (Google/Microsoft)
- Telephony/dialer; SMS gateways
- Marketing platforms; landing pages
- ERP/Inventory for customers, products, orders

## Sync Model
- Master data ownership rules; conflict resolution
- Incremental sync with webhooks and polling fallbacks
- Mapping templates; validation and error queues

## Security & Governance
- OAuth2, scoped permissions, audit of data exchanges
- Rate limits, retries with backoff, dead-letter handling
