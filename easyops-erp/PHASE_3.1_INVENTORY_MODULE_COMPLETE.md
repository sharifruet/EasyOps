## üìä **Implementation Summary**

### ‚úÖ **1. Database Schema (25 Changesets)**

**Schema**: `inventory`

**Core Tables Created:**
1. **product_categories** - Product categorization (5 categories)
2. **products** - Comprehensive product master (12 products)
3. **warehouses** - Warehouse/location management (4 warehouses)
4. **stock_locations** - Bins/racks within warehouses
5. **stock** - Real-time stock levels by product/warehouse (11 records)
6. **stock_movements** - All stock transactions/audit trail (4 movements)
7. **stock_transfers** - Inter-warehouse transfers
8. **stock_transfer_lines** - Transfer line items
9. **stock_adjustments** - Manual stock adjustments
10. **stock_adjustment_lines** - Adjustment details
11. **batch_lots** - Batch/lot tracking for expiry management
12. **serial_numbers** - Serial number tracking
13. **reorder_rules** - Automated reordering configuration
14. **stock_counts** - Physical inventory counts
15. **stock_count_lines** - Count line details

**Views Created:**
- `v_stock_summary` - Aggregated stock by product/warehouse with status
- `v_expiring_stock` - Products approaching expiry

## üéì **Key Learnings & Notes**

### **Design Decisions**:
1. **Quantity States**: Separated On Hand vs Available vs Allocated for better control
2. **Flexible Schema**: Supports batch/serial tracking without forcing it on all products
3. **Multi-Warehouse**: Stock tracked separately per warehouse for accurate fulfillment
4. **Audit Trail**: All movements logged with source references
5. **Weighted Average Costing**: Simple yet effective for most businesses

### **Performance Optimizations**:
- Redis caching on frequently accessed data (products, warehouses)
- Database indexes on all foreign keys and query fields
- Efficient query patterns in repositories

### **Integration Architecture**:
- Feign clients for service-to-service communication
- Event-driven design ready (stock movements can trigger notifications)
- Loosely coupled modules
