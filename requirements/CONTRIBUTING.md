## Writing Style
- Be concise and action-oriented; prefer bullets over prose.
- Use consistent headings: H1 for file title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections.
- Include field lists where relevant with names and brief descriptions.

## Template
- Problem statement
- User roles & permissions
- Entities & fields
- Core flows (numbered steps)
- Validations & business rules
- Integrations & events
- Reports & KPIs
- Edge cases & exceptions

## Formatting
- Use American English.
- Keep one feature per bullet; sub-bullets for fields and features.
- Avoid screenshots; link to specs if needed.

## Traceability
- Optionally add tags: `[EPIC:]`, `[STORY:]`, `[ID:]` to link to backlogs.
