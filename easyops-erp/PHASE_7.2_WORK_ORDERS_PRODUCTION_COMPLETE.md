## 📈 **BUSINESS LOGIC WORKFLOWS**

### **Work Order Creation Flow**:
```
1. Create work order with product and quantity
2. System auto-generates work order number
3. If BOM is specified:
   a. Generate operations from routing
   b. Generate materials from BOM explosion
   c. Calculate planned quantities with scrap
4. Work order status = CREATED
```

### **Work Order Release Flow**:
```
1. Validate work order is in CREATED status
2. Reserve all required materials
3. Update material status to RESERVED
4. Set release date and released_by
5. Change work order status to RELEASED
```

### **Work Order Start Flow**:
```
1. Validate work order is in RELEASED status
2. Set actual start date
3. Change work order status to IN_PROGRESS
```

### **Operation Tracking Flow**:
```
1. Start operation:
   - Set actual start time
   - Assign to user
   - Status = IN_PROGRESS
   - Update work order progress
2. Complete operation:
   - Set actual end time
   - Record quantity completed/rejected
   - Calculate actual time
   - Status = COMPLETED
   - Update work order progress
```

### **Material Issuance Flow**:
```
1. Validate material is RESERVED
2. Record issued quantity
3. Set issued date and issued_by
4. Change status to ISSUED
```

### **Work Order Completion Flow**:
```
1. Validate work order is IN_PROGRESS
2. Backflush all backflush-enabled materials
3. Recalculate all costs
4. Set actual end date
5. Set completion percentage to 100%
6. Change status to COMPLETED
```

## 🔢 **CALCULATED FIELDS & METRICS**

### **Work Order Metrics**:
- Completion percentage = (Operations Completed / Total Operations) × 100
- Total cost = Material Cost + Labor Cost + Overhead Cost
- Actual duration = Actual End Date - Actual Start Date
- Days since created = Current Date - Created Date
- Days until due = Planned End Date - Current Date

### **Operation Metrics**:
- Total time planned = Setup + (Run × Quantity) + Teardown
- Time variance % = (Actual - Planned) / Planned × 100
- Efficiency % = Planned / Actual × 100
- Quality % = Completed / (Completed + Rejected) × 100

### **Material Metrics**:
- Quantity shortage = Required - Reserved
- Extended cost = Quantity Consumed × Unit Cost

### **Production Metrics**:
- Yield % = Quantity Completed / Quantity Planned × 100
- Scrap rate % = Scrapped / (Completed + Scrapped) × 100
- Cost per unit = Total Cost / Quantity Completed
