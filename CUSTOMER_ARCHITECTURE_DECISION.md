# Customer Architecture - CRM vs Sales Decision

## The Question
**Where should customer master data be managed: CRM or Sales?**

---

## 📊 Analysis of Requirements

### CRM Module Requirements (accounts_contacts.md)

**Purpose**: "Maintain a clean master of organizations (accounts) and people (contacts) for 360° customer view"

**Account (CRM)**:
- Name, Type (Customer/Prospect/Partner/Vendor)
- Industry, Size, Tax IDs
- Billing/Shipping addresses
- Payment Terms, Currency
- Territory assignment
- **Lifecycle**: Prospect → Active → Inactive

**Focus**: Relationship management, sales pipeline, B2B

---

### Sales Module Requirements (customer_management_detailed.md)

**Purpose**: "Manage comprehensive customer master for B2B/B2C with clean data, clear governance"

**Customer (Sales)**:
- Customer profiles (name, contact, address)
- Customer segmentation
- Purchase history
- Loyalty programs & rewards
- Credit limit & outstanding balance
- Communication history
- **Focus**: Transactional customers, B2C, purchase behavior

## 🎯 Three Possible Architectures

### **Option 1: CRM as Master (B2B Focused)** ⭐ Current Implementation

```
CRM Service
└── Accounts (Companies/Organizations)
    ├── Type: Customer, Prospect, Partner, Vendor
    ├── Contacts (People within accounts)
    ├── Leads → Convert to Account
    ├── Opportunities
    └── Activities

Sales Service
└── Transactions
    ├── Quotations (references CRM Account)
    ├── Sales Orders (references CRM Account)
    └── Deliveries

AR Service
└── Customer Financial Data
    ├── Credit limits
    ├── Outstanding balances
    ├── Invoices & payments
    └── Aging reports
```

**Best For**:
- ✅ B2B businesses
- ✅ Relationship-focused selling
- ✅ Complex sales cycles
- ✅ Account-based sales (multiple contacts per company)
- ✅ Lead nurturing and pipeline management

**Pros**:
- Single source of truth for customer data
- CRM manages full customer lifecycle (lead → customer)
- Natural fit for B2B where "account" = company
- Separates relationship data from transactional data

**Cons**:
- Less suitable for B2C with individual customers
- CRM module must be implemented first
- More complex for simple transactional sales

---

### **Option 2: Sales as Master (B2C/Transactional Focused)**

```
Sales Service
└── Customers (Master Data)
    ├── Customer profiles
    ├── Purchase history
    ├── Loyalty & rewards
    ├── Quotations & Orders
    └── Delivery preferences

CRM Service (Optional)
└── Pre-Sales
    ├── Leads (converts to Sales Customer)
    ├── Prospects
    ├── Marketing campaigns
    └── Opportunities (converts to Sales Order)

AR Service
└── Customer Financial Data
    ├── Same as Option 1
```

**Best For**:
- ✅ B2C businesses (individual customers)
- ✅ E-commerce
- ✅ Retail
- ✅ Transaction-focused (less relationship management)
- ✅ Simple, direct sales

**Pros**:
- Simpler for B2C
- Sales module can work independently
- Natural fit for retail/e-commerce
- Customer data close to transactions

**Cons**:
- Limited CRM capabilities
- Less suitable for complex B2B sales
- Potential duplicate if you later add CRM

---

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Both)**

```
CRM Service
└── Accounts & Contacts (B2B Master)
    ├── Corporate customers
    ├── Leads → Accounts
    ├── Account-based selling
    └── Opportunities

Sales Service
└── Customers (B2C Master)
    ├── Individual customers
    ├── Walk-in/retail customers
    ├── Direct orders
    └── Loyalty programs

AR Service
└── Unified Financial View
    ├── Links to both CRM Accounts and Sales Customers
    └── Manages credit/invoices for both

Sales Transactions
├── If B2B: Reference CRM Account
└── If B2C: Reference Sales Customer
```

**Best For**:
- ✅ Mixed B2B + B2C business
- ✅ Different processes for corporate vs individual
- ✅ Enterprise with multiple sales channels

**Pros**:
- Supports both B2B and B2C
- Flexible for different business models
- Specialized features for each type

**Cons**:
- More complex architecture
- Need to manage two customer types
- More integration points

## 📋 Current EasyOps Implementation

### What's Currently Built:

**CRM Service** ✅:
- `crm.accounts` table (exists)
- `crm.contacts` table (exists)
- `crm.leads` table (exists)
- `crm.opportunities` table (exists)
- Full CRM workflows implemented

## 💡 My Recommendation

### **Keep CRM as Master** (Option 1) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Why?**

1. **Requirements Alignment**:
   - CRM requirements say: "Sync with ERP customers/vendors"
   - This suggests CRM → ERP direction (CRM is source)
   - CRM manages full lifecycle: Lead → Account → Customer

2. **Already Implemented**:
   - CRM Account entity is complete with 4 test accounts
   - CRM has full features (leads, contacts, opportunities)
   - Sales is already updated to use CRM references

3. **EasyOps is ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planning):
   - ERPs typically serve B2B businesses
   - B2B = Account-based selling
   - CRM Account = Company/Organization (natural fit)

4. **Flexibility**:
   - CRM Account Type can be: Customer, Prospect, Partner, Vendor
   - Can still track individual buyers as Contacts within Accounts
   - For B2C: Create Account per individual customer (with 1 Contact)

5. **Financial Integration**:
   - AR Service has separate `accounting.customers` for financial tracking
   - CRM Account (master) → AR Customer (financial) mapping
   - Clean separation: relationship vs transactions

## 🔄 How It Works with CRM as Master

### Customer Lifecycle

```
1. Marketing captures Lead
   ↓
2. Sales qualifies Lead
   ↓
3. Convert Lead to Account (CRM)
   ↓
4. Create Contact(s) within Account
   ↓
5. Create Opportunity
   ↓
6. Create Quotation (Sales) → references CRM Account
   ↓
7. Convert to Sales Order → references CRM Account
   ↓
8. Generate Invoice (AR) → AR Customer synced from CRM Account
   ↓
9. Track payments and aging in AR
```

### Data Distribution

| Data Type | Service | Table |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Master Customer Data** | CRM | `crm.accounts` |
| Contact Persons | CRM | `crm.contacts` |
| Leads/Prospects | CRM | `crm.leads` |
| Opportunities | CRM | `crm.opportunities` |
| **Quotations** | Sales | `sales.quotations` |
| **Sales Orders** | Sales | `sales.sales_orders` |
| **Financial Data** | AR | `accounting.customers` |
| Credit/Invoices/Aging | AR | AR tables |

---

## ✅ Recommended: Keep Current Architecture

### CRM Service Owns:
- ✅ **Accounts** (master customer/company data)
- ✅ **Contacts** (people)
- ✅ **Leads** (prospects)
- ✅ **Opportunities** (sales pipeline)
- ✅ **Activities** (interactions)

### Sales Service References:
- Account ID (from CRM)
- Uses account data for quotations and orders
- Denormalizes name, email, address for performance

### AR Service Mirrors:
- Creates AR Customer record when needed
- Tracks financial relationship
- Separate concern from master data

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Move to Sales if Needed

**IF** your business is:
- Primarily B2C (individual customers)
- E-commerce/retail focused
- Simple, transactional sales
- No complex CRM needs

**THEN** you could:
1. Keep `sales.customers` table
2. Make Sales the master
3. CRM becomes optional for pre-sales only
4. Revert our cleanup changes

But this would require:
- Re-creating Customer in Sales Service
- Moving 4 CRM accounts to Sales
- Updating all references back
- Deciding what to do with CRM module

---

## 🎯 Final Recommendation

### **KEEP CRM AS MASTER** ⭐

**Reasons**:
1. ✅ EasyOps is enterprise ERP (B2B focus)
2. ✅ CRM module is already fully built
3. ✅ Follows industry best practices
4. ✅ Clean separation of concerns
5. ✅ Scalable for growth

**Action**:
- ✅ Keep current architecture (CRM as master)
- ✅ Sales references CRM Accounts
- ✅ Update frontend type mappings (which we're doing now)
- ✅ Document the architecture clearly

**For B2C Support**:
- Create one Account per individual customer
- Account.name = Customer's full name
- Account.type = "INDIVIDUAL" or "B2C_CUSTOMER"
- Still works, just different data model

---

## 📝 Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where should customers be?** | CRM Service (as Accounts) |
| **Why?** | B2B focus, full lifecycle, already built |
| **What about Sales customers?** | Sales references CRM Accounts |
| **What about AR customers?** | AR mirrors for financial tracking |
