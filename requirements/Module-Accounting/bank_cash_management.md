## Appendix

### A. Worked Examples

#### A.1 Bank Reconciliation Example
- Scenario: Reconcile bank statement ending balance 50,000 with book balance 49,500
- Statement items: Interest credit 200, Bank charges 50, Outstanding cheques 1,000, Deposits in transit 250
- Adjustments: Post interest (Dr Bank 200, Cr Interest Income 200); Post charges (Dr Bank Charges 50, Cr Bank 50)
- Result: Book balance = 49,500 + 200 - 50 = 49,650; Statement balance = 50,000 - 1,000 + 250 = 49,250; Variance = 400 (investigate)

#### A.2 Petty Cash Replenishment
- Scenario: Petty cash fund of 5,000 with 800 remaining; expenses: Office supplies 1,200, Transport 1,000, Meals 1,000
- Journal: Dr Petty Cash 4,200, Cr Bank 4,200; Dr Office Supplies 1,200, Dr Transport 1,000, Dr Meals 1,000, Cr Petty Cash 3,200
- Result: Fund restored to 5,000; expenses properly categorized

#### A.3 Cross-Currency Transfer
- Scenario: Transfer 10,000 USD from USD account to EUR account at rate 0.85
- Journal: Dr Bank EUR 8,500, Cr Bank USD 10,000, Cr FX Gain 1,500 (if rate favorable)
- Result: USD account debited, EUR account credited, FX impact posted

### B. Glossary (Bank & Cash)
- Bank Reconciliation: Process of matching bank statement with book records
- Clearing: Time between cheque deposit and funds availability
- Float: Time between payment issue and bank debit

- Outstanding: Cheques issued but not yet cleared by bank
- Petty Cash: Small cash fund for minor expenses
- Reconciliation Variance: Difference between bank and book balances
- Stop Payment: Instruction to bank to not honor a specific cheque
