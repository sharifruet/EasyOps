### 1. Purpose & Scope
- Enable field and warehouse users to operate via mobile, and integrate sensors/IoT for real-time inventory state

### 2. Mobile App Access & Security
- App User ID, User/Role, Device ID/Type, App Version, Login/Logout, Last Activity, Permissions, Status, Notes
- Security: device binding, 2FA (optional), offline session policies

### 3. Mobile Inventory Operations
- Transaction ID, Product/SKU, Batch/Lot/Serial, Location, Qty +/- / Transfer, UoM, Triggered by, Timestamp, Notes
- Flows: scan â†’ validate â†’ confirm â†’ sync; offline capture with conflict resolution

### 4. Mobile Approvals & Workflows
- Workflow ID, Transaction refs (PO/SO/Adjust/Transfer), Requestor, Approver/Role, Status, Dates, Notes
- SLA and escalations; quick actions with audit

### 5. IoT Device Integration
- Device ID/Type (RFID, sensor, GPS, scanner), Linked Product/Batch/Serial, Location, Status, Last Txn, Data Types, Notes
- Security: provisioning, key rotation, access scopes

### 6. Real-Time Stock & Condition Monitoring
- Monitoring ID, Product/Batch/Serial, Location, Stock levels, Sensor data, Timestamp, Alerts, Notes

### 7. Alerts & Notifications
- Alert ID, Trigger (low stock/expiry/temperature/motion/delay/damage), Product/Batch/Serial, Location, Priority, Recipient, Method, Status, Timestamp

### 8. Geolocation & Tracking
- Tracking ID, Device/Vehicle, Route, GPS coordinates, Timestamp, Movement status, Notes

### 9. Device Health & Maintenance
- Device ID, Last/Next maintenance, Battery/Power, Connectivity, Faults, Technician, Notes

### 10. Integrations
- Integration ID, Source (Inventory/Warehouse/Logistics/Mobile), Destination (ERP/BI/Accounting), Data types, Sync type, Status, Timestamps, Error log

### 11. Validations & Edge Cases
- Validations: device auth, duplicate scans, stale sensor data, location accuracy thresholds
- Edge Cases: offline operations with delayed sync; sensor drift; GPS loss; tamper alerts
