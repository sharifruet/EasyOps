# Duplicate Implementation Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Removed duplicate entity implementations from Sales Service and updated all related references to follow proper service boundaries.

## Files Deleted

### From Sales Service

#### Product-related (5 files)
1. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/entity/Product.java`
2. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/controller/ProductController.java`
3. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/service/ProductService.java`
4. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/repository/ProductRepository.java`
5. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/dto/ProductRequest.java`

**Rationale**: Product catalog management belongs in **Inventory Service**, not Sales Service. Sales Service should reference products via API calls to Inventory Service.

#### Customer-related (5 files)
1. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/entity/Customer.java`
2. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/controller/CustomerController.java`
3. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/service/CustomerService.java`
4. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/repository/CustomerRepository.java`
5. ✅ `services/sales-service/src/main/java/com/easyops/sales/dto/CustomerRequest.java`

**Rationale**: Customer master data belongs in **CRM Service** (as Account). Sales Service should reference CRM accounts, not maintain its own customer records.

## Files Updated

### Sales Service

#### 1. `SalesIntegrationService.java`
**Changes**:
- Removed import of `com.easyops.sales.entity.Customer`
- Removed dependency on `CustomerRepository`
- Updated `findOrCreateARCustomer()` method to not use local Customer entity
- Added TODO comment for CRM-to-AR customer sync implementation

**Impact**: The service now expects customer data to come from CRM service rather than local database.

#### 2. `QuotationService.java`
**Changes**:
- Removed import of `com.easyops.sales.entity.Customer`
- Removed dependency on `CustomerRepository`
- Updated `createQuotation()` method to:
  - Require customer details in the request
  - Use customer data from request instead of database lookup
  - Added validation for required customer ID

**Impact**: Frontend/API clients must now provide complete customer information when creating quotations.

#### 3. `SalesOrderService.java`
**Changes**:
- Removed import of `com.easyops.sales.repository.CustomerRepository`
- Removed dependency on `CustomerRepository`
- Updated `createOrder()` method to:
  - Require customer details in the request
  - Use customer data from request instead of database lookup
  - Added validation for required customer ID

**Impact**: Frontend/API clients must now provide complete customer information when creating sales orders.

## Service Ownership Architecture

### Product Management
- **Owner**: Inventory Service
- **Schema**: `inventory.products`
- **Features**:
  - SKU, barcode, pricing
  - Stock levels and tracking
  - Categories, brands, suppliers
  - Physical attributes (weight, dimensions)
  - GL account mappings
  
### Customer Management  
- **Owner**: CRM Service (as Account)
- **Schema**: `crm.accounts`
- **Features**:
  - Company information
  - Contact details
  - Addresses
  - Industry, type, source
  - Opportunity tracking

### Customer Financial Data
- **Owner**: AR Service  
- **Schema**: `accounting.customers`
- **Features**:
  - Credit limits
  - Payment terms
  - Current balances
  - Invoice history
  - Aging reports

### Sales Transactions
- **Owner**: Sales Service
- **Schema**: `sales.sales_orders`, `sales.quotations`
- **Features**:
  - Sales orders
  - Quotations
  - Order lines
  - References to CRM accounts (customer_id)
  - References to inventory products (product_id)

## Integration Pattern

### Before (Incorrect - Duplication)
```
Sales Service
├── Own Product entity (WRONG)
├── Own Customer entity (WRONG)
├── Sales Orders
└── Quotations
```

### After (Correct - Microservice Pattern)
```
Sales Service
├── Sales Orders
│   ├── References CRM Account (customer_id)
│   └── References Inventory Product (product_id)
└── Quotations
    ├── References CRM Account (customer_id)
    └── References Inventory Product (product_id)

CRM Service (Master Data)
└── Accounts (customers, prospects)

Inventory Service (Master Data)
└── Products (catalog)

AR Service (Financial Data)
└── Customers (receivables, credit)
```

## API Contract Changes

### SalesOrderRequest
**Required fields now include**:
```json
{
  "customerId": "uuid",
  "customerName": "string",  // NEW - must be provided
  "customerEmail": "string", // NEW - must be provided
  "contactPerson": "string",
  "billingAddress": "string",
  "shippingAddress": "string",
  ...
}
```

### QuotationRequest
**Required fields now include**:
```json
{
  "customerId": "uuid",
  "customerName": "string",  // NEW - must be provided
  "customerEmail": "string", // NEW - must be provided
  "contactPerson": "string",
  "billingAddress": "string",
  "shippingAddress": "string",
  ...
}
```

## Migration Notes

### Frontend Changes Required
The frontend must now:

1. **For Sales Orders/Quotations**:
   - Fetch customer data from CRM service (Account API)
   - Fetch product data from Inventory service (Product API)
   - Include full customer details in create/update requests
   - Include full product details in line items

2. **Example Flow**:
```typescript
// 1. Get customer from CRM
const customer = await crmApi.getAccount(customerId);

// 2. Get product from Inventory
const product = await inventoryApi.getProduct(productId);

// 3. Create sales order with data from both services
const order = await salesApi.createOrder({
  customerId: customer.id,
  customerName: customer.name,
  customerEmail: customer.email,
  // ... other customer fields from CRM
  lines: [{
    productId: product.id,
    productName: product.name,
    productCode: product.sku,
    // ... other product fields from Inventory
  }]
});
```

### Backend Integration Needed

#### TODO Items
1. **CRM → AR Sync**: When a CRM Account is converted to a customer, sync to AR Service
2. **Inventory → Sales**: Sales Service should call Inventory Service API for product details
3. **CRM → Sales**: Sales Service should call CRM Service API for customer details

## Benefits

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
- Products: Only in Inventory Service
- Customers: Master data in CRM, financial data in AR
- No data duplication or sync issues

### 2. **Clear Service Boundaries**
- Each service owns its domain
- Easier to maintain and evolve
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. **Scalability**
- Services can scale independently
- Inventory catalog can grow without affecting Sales
- CRM can manage customers without duplicating to Sales

### 4. **Data Consistency**
- One place to update product information
- One place to update customer information
- Changes immediately visible across all services

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Performance
**Problem**: Multiple service calls for each operation  
**Solution**: 
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use API gateway for aggregation
- Consider materialized views for read-heavy operations

### Issue 2: Service Availability
**Problem**: Sales Service depends on CRM and Inventory  
**Solution**:
- Implement circuit breakers
- Cache last-known-good data
- Graceful degradation strategies

### Issue 3: Transaction Boundaries
**Problem**: Can't use database transactions across services  
**Solution**:
- Implement saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Use event-driven eventual consistency
- Compensating transactions for rollbacks

## Testing Impact

### Unit Tests
- Remove tests for deleted Product/Customer entities
- Update service tests to mock CRM/Inventory clients
- Add validation tests for required customer fields

### Integration Tests
- Test inter-service communication
- Test with CRM and Inventory services running
- Test error handling when services are unavailable

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Code Changes (✅ COMPLETE)
- Remove duplicate entities
- Update service dependencies
- Update API contracts

### Phase 2: Database Migration (PENDING)
- Verify no orphaned data in `sales.products` table
- Verify no orphaned data in `sales.customers` table
- Create migration script to drop tables

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates (PENDING)

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (PENDING)
- End-to-end testing with all services
