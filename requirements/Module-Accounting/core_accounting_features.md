### 9.1 Purpose & Principles
- Purpose
  - Guarantee accounting integrity across all postings with a provable, auditable mechanism that enforces Debits = Credits at every level.
- Principles
  - Every transaction posts at least two lines (debit and credit) and balances at header level
  - No orphan lines: lines must belong to a valid journal header in a valid period
  - Immutable posted entries; changes via reversal/correcting entries only
  - Traceability: every line references its source (module, document, user, time)

### 9.2 Posting Engine Requirements
- Balancing & Currency
  - Validate balance in functional currency; support additional checks in reporting currency
  - Multi-currency lines converted using effective FX rate; rounding posted to configured accounts
- Atomicity & Idempotency
  - Post all lines or none; transactional commit with rollback on failure
  - Idempotent posting using correlation id/hash to prevent duplicates from replays
- Concurrency & Sequencing
  - Prevent race conditions on sequences and period state; optimistic concurrency on journals
  - Batch posting support with retries and dead-letter queue for failures
- Performance
  - High-volume posting via streaming/bulk APIs; background processing for heavy batches

### 9.3 Validations & Controls
- Structural
  - Sum(debits) = Sum(credits) per journal; no zero-value lines unless allowed by policy
  - Accounts must be active, posting-allowed, not locked; dimensions must satisfy account policy
- Period & Policy
  - Posting date within open period; warn/block per role on exceptions
  - Control accounts: manual-post policy enforced (block/warn/allow);
  - FX rate availability and validity by date/source; fallback hierarchy

### 9.4 Error Handling & Recovery
- Validation errors returned with actionable messages (account, line no., reason)
- Partial-import handling: accept valid lines into draft, reject invalid lines with report
- Auto-created corrective entries for rounding differences within tolerance; escalate otherwise
- Comprehensive audit: who/when/what, previous vs new values, correlation id

### 9.5 Edge Cases
- Mixed-currency vouchers with line-level rates; enforce single functional currency balance
- Backdated postings after revaluation or close; require approval and auto-detect re-statement impact
- Precision/rounding differences across currencies; tolerance and rounding accounts
- Posting reversals that affect dependent reports (e.g., cash flow classification) with re-tagging

    - Soft lock for final review; hard lock upon approval; auditor read-only access

- Reconciliation Reports
  - AR aging vs GL control; AP aging vs GL control; Inventory valuation vs GL; Bank unreconciled items; GR/IR clearing
  - Exception lists with drill-down and notes; certification sign-off capture

- Automation & Scheduling
  - Close calendar per company/branch; reminders/alerts; task assignments and completion tracking
  - Templates for standard close journals (depreciation, accruals) with schedules

- Validations & Rules
  - Prevent lock if critical reconciliations show variances beyond threshold (override with justification)
  - Require attachments for material journals; enforce dimension completeness for period close entries
  - Re-open requires approval and audit justification; changes tracked and reported

- Edge Cases
  - 52/53-week fiscal years; shortened/extended periods
  - Multi-company staggered close; consolidation alignment window
  - Late-arriving documents after close (handled via next-period adjustments with disclosure)

## 14. Opening Balances & Migration
- Purpose
  - Onboard entities with accurate opening balances and master data while preserving auditability and reconciliation to legacy systems.

- Scope & Data Sources
  - Trial balance openings by account/branch/currency
  - Subledger openings: AR (customer-level, invoice/aging), AP (vendor-level, bill/aging), Inventory (item/warehouse quantities and costs)
  - Bank statement starting balances; fixed assets register (if applicable)

- Templates & Fields
  - TB Template: Account Code, Account Name, Branch/Company, Currency, Debit, Credit, Notes
  - AR/AP Template: Party Code/Name, Doc No (optional), Due Date, Currency, Amount, Tax, Aging Bucket
  - Inventory Template: SKU, Description, UoM, Warehouse, Quantity, Unit Cost, Batch/Lot/Serial (optional), Valuation Method
  - Mapping Tables: legacy account/party/item codes to EasyOps codes

- Process (Steps)
  1) Prepare & Map
    - Import mapping tables; validate completeness and duplicates
  2) Import & Validate
    - Load TB and subledger files; run validations (accounts active, dimensions allowed, sums match)
  3) Post Openings
    - Auto-generate opening journals per module with source = Migration
    - Inventory openings post to inventory and offset to opening equity/suspense as per policy
  4) Reconcile
    - TB totals vs legacy TB; AR/AP aging totals vs control accounts; inventory valuation vs GL
  5) Sign-off
    - Controller certification; lock migration period; archive import artifacts

- Controls & Validations
  - Balanced TB import (Debit = Credit); currency conversions applied consistently
  - Control accounts postings follow manual-post policy; use opening-specific paths if blocked
  - Attachments required: legacy TB, aging reports, inventory valuation reports

- Cutover & Rollback
  - Cutover date defined; final delta entries to capture late transactions from legacy
  - Rollback plan with ability to reverse migration journals before go-live lock

- Edge Cases
  - Multi-currency openings with historical rates; revaluation immediately after go-live
  - Legacy data quality issues (duplicates, missing codes) handled via exception queue
  - Partial module onboarding (e.g., GL first, AR/AP later) with interim controls

---

## 15. Multi-Currency Enhancements
- Purpose
  - Support transactions in multiple currencies with accurate conversion, posting, revaluation, and reporting across functional and reporting currencies.

- Currency Model
  - Company Functional Currency; optional Group Reporting Currency
  - Transaction Currency at journal line level; account currency policy (functional/reporting)
  - FX Rate Types: Spot, Average, Month-End, Custom; effective-dated

- Rates & Sources
  - Rate Sources: manual table, provider API (e.g., ECB), uploaded files
  - Hierarchy and fallback rules; approvals for manual overrides; audit of changes

- Posting & Conversion
  - Convert transaction amounts to functional and reporting currencies at posting time
  - Rounding policy with tolerance and rounding accounts; per-currency precision settings
  - Realized FX gain/loss on settlement for AR/AP and bank

- Period-End Revaluation
  - Revalue monetary account balances using period-end rate; post unrealized FX gain/loss
  - Support reversal in next period or roll-forward; detailed revaluation report (before/after)
  - Exclusions/overrides for specific accounts or balances

- Reporting
  - Trial Balance, P&L, and Balance Sheet in functional and reporting currency
  - Disclosure of FX impacts (realized vs unrealized) with drill-down to source

- Validations & Rules
  - Missing rate detection with blocking/warning per policy; rate effective date must cover posting date
  - Consistent rate type across a voucher unless allowed; document-level lock of rate when required

- Edge Cases
  - Hyperinflationary adjustments (if applicable); parallel reporting currency restatement
  - Multi-currency vouchers with mixed lines; revaluation of partially settled items

---

## 16. Controls, Approvals, and Audit
- Purpose
  - Enforce governance over financial processes with approvals, segregation of duties, and complete auditability.

- Approvals & Thresholds
  - Maker-checker workflows for journals, revaluations, adjustments, period close
  - Thresholds by amount, account groups, and dimensions; multi-step approvals
  - Delegation, escalation, SLAs, and reminders; vacation/backup assignees

- Segregation of Duties (SoD)
  - Define conflicting role combinations (e.g., create + approve + post)
  - Prevent or flag transactions violating SoD; require compensating controls/approvals

- Access Control & Visibility
  - Role- and branch-scoped permissions for viewing/posting/editing
  - Sensitive accounts and fields masked for non-authorized users

- Audit Trail
  - Immutable logs of create/edit/approve/post/reverse with before/after values
  - Correlation IDs across modules; exportable logs and retention policies

- Period Locks & Exceptions
  - Soft/hard locks; override with justification and approver trail
  - Exception register capturing who, why, when, and impact

- Monitoring & Reporting
  - Control dashboards (pending approvals, exceptions, SoD violations)
  - Audit readiness reports (change logs, access review, control attestations)

- Validations & Rules
  - Approval required before posting for configured scenarios
  - Changes to CoA, rate tables, and numbering require higher-level approvals

- Edge Cases
  - Emergency posting procedures with post-facto approval
  - External auditor read-only access with scoped time-bound permissions
